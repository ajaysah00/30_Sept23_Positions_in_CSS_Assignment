Explain the z-index, with a code example.

= The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of elements on a web page along the z-axis (the axis that extends from the screen towards you). Elements with higher z-index values will appear on top of elements with lower z-index values. This property is commonly used when you have overlapping elements and need to control their relative visibility.

Here is code example
-
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    .box {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      position: absolute;
    }

    #box1 {
      background-color: red;
      left: 50px;
      top: 50px;
      z-index: 1; /* This box will be behind box2 */
    }

    #box2 {
      background-color: blue;
      left: 75px;
      top: 75px;
      z-index: 2; /* This box will be on top of box1 */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="box" id="box1"></div>
  <div class="box" id="box2"></div>
</body>
</html>
